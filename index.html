                        Some speak of a black-robed terrorist known only as the Reaper. His identity and motives are a mystery. 
                        What is known is that where he appears, death follows.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Reaper is an extremely volatile mercenary, a ruthless and remorseless killer responsible for terrorist 
                        attacks across the world. He has fought in many armed conflicts in the last decades, showing no loyalty to 
                        any cause or organization.

                        Survivors have described a black shadow ghosting unscathed through the most hellish battlefields. The few 
                        bodies recovered of those he kills are pale, empty husks drained of life, their cells showing signs of 
                        intense degradation. It is possible that he is a byproduct of failed genetic alteration which forces his 
                        cells to simultaneously decay and regenerate at a hyper-accelerated rate.

                        Reaper is hunting former Overwatch agents and systematically eliminating them.

                        Armed with his Peacekeeper revolver, the outlaw Jesse McCree doles out justice on his own terms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        McCree had already made a name for himself as a member of the notorious Deadlock Gang, which trafficked in 
                        illicit weapons and military hardware throughout the American Southwest, when he and his associates were 
                        busted in an Overwatch sting operation. With his expert marksmanship and resourcefulness, he was given the 
                        choice between rotting in a maximum-security lockup and joining Blackwatch, Overwatch's covert ops division. He chose the latter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although he was initially cynical, he came to believe that he could make amends for his past sins by 
                        righting the injustices of the world. McCree appreciated the flexibility afforded to the clandestine 
                        Blackwatch, unhindered by bureaucracy and red tape. But as Overwatch's influence waned, rogue elements 
                        within Blackwatch sought to bring down the organization and turn it to their own ends. Wanting no part of 
                        the infighting, McCree set off alone and went underground.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He resurfaced several years later as a gunslinger for hire. But while McCree's talents are sought after by 
                        parties great and small, he fights only for causes he believes are just.

                    <p>
                        Mei is a scientist who has taken the fight to preserve the environment into her own hands.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though many blamed the planet's escalating, unexplained climate phenomena on the advent of new 
                        technologies, the rapidly growing omnic population, and drastically increased consumption of resources, 
                        the true cause remained unknown. To find a solution, Overwatch established a series of eco-Watchpoints at 
                        remote, critical locations worldwide.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mei-Ling Zhou was a member of this multiyear initiative. A peerless climatologist, she had introduced 
                        cutting-edge innovations in the field of climate manipulation that protected at-risk areas in Asia and 
                        beyond. She was assigned to the program's monitoring station at Watchpoint: Antarctica when disaster 
                        struck: a sudden, catastrophic polar storm battered the installation and cut it off from the outside 
                        world, leaving the facility damaged and the scientists stranded. As their supplies dwindled, they entered 
                        cryostasis in a last-ditch effort to survive until a rescue attempt could be made.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But that rescue never came. It was years later when the team's cryogenics chamber was finally discovered. 
                        Mei, still in hibernation, was the only survivor. The world Mei awoke to had gone through considerable 
                        changes: Overwatch was no more, the serious climate issues had worsened, and none of the eco-Watchpoints 
                        were in operation. Any clues that they had uncovered were lost.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mei has decided to continue her work on her own. Equipped with a portable version of her 
                        climate-manipulation technology, she travels around the world, hoping to re-establish the eco-network and 
                        track down the causes of the threats to the planet's ecosystem.

                <div class="backstory">
                    <h1>- Real Name: Genji Shimada, Age: 35 -</h1>
                    <p>
                        The cyborg Genji Shimada has made peace with the augmented body he once rejected, and in doing so, he has 
                        discovered a higher humanity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the youngest son of the master of the Shimada ninja clan, Genji lived a life of luxury and privilege. He 
                        had little interest in the family's illegal businesses, and although he excelled at and enjoyed his ninja 
                        training, he spent most of his time pursuing a playboy lifestyle. Many within the clan considered the 
                        carefree Genji to be a dangerous liability, and they resented his father for coddling and protecting him. 
                        Following the clan leader's untimely death, Genji's older brother, Hanzo, demanded that Genji take a more 
                        active role in their late father's empire. Genji refused, enraging Hanzo. The tension between the brothers 
                        built to a violent confrontation that left Genji on the verge of dying.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hanzo believed that he had killed his brother, but Genji was rescued by Overwatch and the intervention of 
                        Dr. Angela Ziegler. The global security force saw Genji as a potential asset in its ongoing operations to 
                        combat the Shimada clan. As Genji's injuries left him clinging to life, Overwatch offered to rebuild his 
                        body in exchange for his help. He was put through an extensive process of cyberization, which enhanced his 
                        natural speed and agility and augmented his superlative ninja skills. Transformed into a living weapon, 
                        Genji single-mindedly set about the task of dismantling his family's criminal empire.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But as time passed, Genji felt increasingly at war with himself. He was repulsed by the mechanical parts of 
                        his body and could not come to grips with what he had become. When his mission was complete, he abandoned 
                        Overwatch and wandered the world in search of meaning. He drifted for many years before crossing paths with 
                        the omnic monk Zenyatta. Though Genji initially rejected Zenyatta's wisdom, the benevolent omnic would not 
                        be deterred. In time, Zenyatta became his mentor, and under the monk's tutelage, Genji reconciled his dual 
                        existence as both man and machine. He learned to accept that although he had a cyborg body, his human soul 
                        was intact, and he came to see his new form as a gift and a unique strength.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, for the first time in his life, Genji is free. Even he cannot say where his path will ultimately lead.

                    <h1>- Real Name: ░░░░░░, Age: 30 -</h1>
                    <p>
                        One of the world's most notorious hackers, Sombra uses information to manipulate those in power.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Long before she took up the alias "Sombra," ░░░░░░ was among the thousands of children who were 
                        left orphaned in the aftermath of the Omnic Crisis. With much of her country's infrastructure 
                        destroyed, she survived by utilizing her natural gifts with hacking and computers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After ░░░░░░ was taken in by Mexico's Los Muertos gang, she aided it in its self-styled revolution 
                        against the government. Los Muertos believed that the rebuilding of Mexico had primarily benefited 
                        the rich and the influential, leaving behind those who were most in need of assistance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Following her many conquests, ░░░░░░ was supremely confident in her skills, but she was caught 
                        unprepared when she stumbled into the web of a global conspiracy—one that had also noticed her. 
                        With her security irreparably compromised, ░░░░░░ was forced to delete all traces of her identity 
                        and went into hiding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She later reemerged as Sombra, upgraded and determined to find out the truth behind the conspiracy 
                        she had uncovered. Sombra launched an even more audacious string of hacks, and her exploits earned 
                        her no shortage of admirers, including Talon. She joined the organization's ranks and is believed 
                        to have contributed to its massive cyberattacks against corporations with strong ties to their 
                        governments. These efforts incited a popular revolution in Mexico against LumériCo and breached 
                        the security of Volskaya Industries, the manufacturing arm of Russia's anti-omnic defense.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, with Talon's extensive resources to call upon, Sombra can focus on her true goal: to unravel the 
                        conspiracy and use the power behind it to her own ends.
